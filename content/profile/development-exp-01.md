Design may be my primary playground, but I'm no stranger to pushing commits. I dive into code, daily. Not just as a hobby, but as a crucial counterpart to my design practice. This hands-on development experience has become my secret weapon, allowing me to bridge the gap between aesthetic vision and technical feasibility. By understanding what happens behind the scenes, I create designs that don't just look beautiful, but actually work beautifully in production. My command of coding fundamentals transforms collaboration with developers from translation to true partnership.
