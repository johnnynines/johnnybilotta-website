      <description>Hello, my name is Johnny! First, thank you for visiting my site. No matter what brought you here, I appreciate your time and interest in who I am and what I do.
I am a digital product designer and front-end developer operating out of Philadelphia. My professional career began during the mid-90s. I started out as a graphic designer, in advertising, after attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia where I studied industrial and product design.</description>
