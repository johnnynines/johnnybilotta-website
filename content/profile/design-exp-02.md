## Creating Impact Through User-Centered Solutions

For me, success isn't measured by aesthetic appeal alone â€“ it's about solving real problems for users and delivering measurable business impact. While I was the VP of Product Design at myClin, I conducted user research and pattern analysis to optimize clinical trial workflow experiences. At Traffic Safety Store, my redesign increased conversion rates from 40% to 92% within six months of launch.

I believe great products emerge at the intersection of user needs, business objectives, and technical feasibility. By understanding all three dimensions, I create solutions that not only delight users but also drive meaningful results.
