I'm a strategic design leader and product innovator with over 25 years of experience crafting exceptional digital experiences across FinTech, Healthcare, and Logistics sectors. What sets me apart is my rare combination of design leadership and technical fluency – I don't just envision great products, I understand how to build them.

My journey began in 1983 at age 7, when I wrote my first BASIC program on an Apple IIe. By my teens, I was mastering AutoCAD and providing electronic drafting services to engineering firms. This foundation of technical understanding has informed my approach to design throughout my career, enabling me to create solutions that are both visually compelling and technically feasible.

Unlike many design leaders, I don't just sketch ideas and hand them off. I contribute significant front-end code, establish technical architecture, and build functional prototypes. My programming journey spans multiple decades and languages – from BASIC in the 1980s to modern JavaScript frameworks today.

This technical depth enables me to make more informed design decisions, anticipate implementation challenges, and communicate effectively with engineering teams. When I design a component, I understand how it will be built, what constraints might arise, and how to optimize for performance and scalability.

Throughout my career as a digital designer, I've leveraged my dual expertise to drive transformation for organizations ranging from startups to enterprise clients like Nike, Kimberly-Clark, CapitalOne, BlackRock and Fidelity.
