#### Local LLM deployment and configuration
Configuring a local LLM using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/ "Ollama for local language models"). This is being installed on an old gaming machine that I wiped clean and set up with Debian 12. The intention is to leverage the API provided by Ollama and create local agents to assist Abby and myself with our work and day to day tasks. <!--more-->

I am hoping to use this experience to show clients how they could set up a local LLM within their organization. These LLMs could handle specialized initatives like writing draft product documentation or automatically compile consumable release notes.

#### MCP Experimentation
Over the last few weeks I have been experimenting with MCP and the Google equivilant A2A protocols. I am keeping notes as I move along and plan on publishing soon.
