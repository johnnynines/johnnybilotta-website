      <title>Wallpaper Wednesday: Destiny 2</title>

      <description>Wallpaper Wednesday is a practice I have not done for many years. In the early days of Indy Hall I would put out a digital wallpaper each week. This helped me stay fresh with design and the suite of tools I use on a regular basis. It also gave me the freedom to explore concepts I normally would not be able to while completing client work. I am humbly attempting to revive this practice with this initial release of the new Wallpaper Wednesday.</description>

      <description>If I start writing in here will it just go to the front of the damn thing and be part of the content that gets pulled in? Because if that is the case than I am sold. I mean that is yet another breakthrough in learning about Hugo.
Man, this has been a lot more difficult than I had originally thought. However, I am beginning to enjoy it. The learning curve is quit a bit but I think I am getting the hang of it now.</description>

      <title>Want to know if your idea is viable?</title>

      <description>Testing the viability of a product or service can be tricky. However, in my experience, I have found that if you explore the answers, provided by two fundamental questions, you can get to a final proof of viability. As well as gain a great foundation for the success of your business, its marketing goals and its customer support.
Question 01: What problem does your product or service solve?
The best products and services in history are supremely successful because they proverbially, scratch a certain itch, felt by enough people, to make a viable market.</description>
