# Hello, my name is Johnny!

First, thank you for visiting my site. No matter what brought you here, I appreciate your time and interest in who I am and what I do.

My name is Johnny, and I am a digital product designer and front-end developer. My career began during the mid-90s, where I started as a graphic designer, in advertising, after attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia, where I studied industrial design. Quickly, my skills as a “computer nerd” coupled with my design abilities made for a skill set that was in demand during the last decade of the 20th century. All universal forces began pushing me first to building websites, then web applications, followed by desktop and mobile software.

Today I stand with the experience of a twenty-five year career in digital design behind me. I have worked on projects ranging from brand development for Nike to product development for Capital One. During the last fifteen years I have held leadership roles not only professionally but within the technology community. Currently, I hold the position as VP of Product Design for myClin. A software product that provides oversight of the assets and essential interactions between all entities conducting a clinical trial sponsored by major pharmaceutical companies.

My work and my personal life are very much interconnected through my love of technology. While I am not a full fledged software developer, I am able to code HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Bash. I am also proficient in all the major operating systems as well as the abilities to administer \*NIX, Windows and Apple systems, networks and other technology infrastructures.

When not pursuing new avenues of my career I spend my time learning ethical hacking, systems administration and network infrastructure. Sprinkle in some Destiny, Forza and various other games on my PC for fun. I also passionately follow motorsports, the Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Union and Tottenham Hotspur.

Currently I reside in Philadelphia, PA with my wife Abby, our two cats Dorian and Phe, and our dog Drax.
