						<h1><a href="https://main.d3p1wyqeqwb6fs.amplifyapp.com/post/destiny-wallpaper/">Wallpaper Wednesday: Destiny 2</a></h1>
						<span>Aug 18, 2021 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>Wallpaper Wednesday is a practice I have not done for many years. In the early days of Indy Hall I would put out a digital wallpaper each week. This helped me stay fresh with design and the suite of tools I use on a regular basis. It also gave me the freedom to explore concepts I normally would not be able to while completing client work. I am humbly attempting to revive this practice with this initial release of the new Wallpaper Wednesday.</p>
<p>This week’s inspiration: Destiny 2 character, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Warmind</p>
<p>I have been using my down time to grind out some missions in Destiny 2 to prepare for the new expansion dropping in November.</p>
<p>A huge part of these missions is running around the system doing tasks for the Warmind AI named, Rasputin. In the game, the Warmind is a sentient, artificial intelligence built by humanity to protect us and the solar system from interstellar threats. While the concept is literally out of this world (the Warmind resides on Mars.) The game designers added some interesting designs to the terminals scattered all over the system, in so much that they used ASCII inspired designs. This, in turn, inspired me to create some digital wallpapers for mobile and desktop, featuring some of the symbols that represent the Warmind and various subroutines.</p>
<p>If you do not play Destiny this will all sound like a bunch of hooey. However the designs of these wallpapers are for all to enjoy. Even more so for those who play Destiny.</p>

					<p>If I start writing in here will it just go to the front of the damn thing and be part of the content that gets pulled in? Because if that is the case than I am sold. I mean that is yet another breakthrough in learning about <strong>Hugo</strong>.</p>
<p>Man, this has been a lot more difficult than I had originally thought. However, I am beginning to enjoy it. The learning curve is quit a bit but I think I am getting the hang of it now. The last trick to learn is how to add inline images and we are <em>golden</em></p>
<h2 id="need-to-place-some-headings-in-here">Need To Place Some Headings In Here</h2>
<p>The next bit is just some markup for testing. Beginning with a <em>blockquote</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just want to say that this blockquote, looks fantastic&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="and-here-we-are-going-to-show-an-ordered-list">And here we are going to show an Ordered List</h3>
<ol>
<li>Item One will start us off</li>
<li>Item Two shows we are still on the right track</li>
<li>We can end it here I think. We get the idea</li>
<li>Well maybe one more item to just check spaceing and all</li>
<li>Maybe this could be the end.</li>
<li>This is the last one I promise</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at what <code>code</code> will look like in our posts. That was a good example of inline <code>code</code> but what about when we have more than one line. Also known as <em>fenced code block</em>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function conFunction(a,b) {
    theObject.logo(&quot;LogoName&quot;);
}
</code></pre><hr>

					<p>Been a minute since I published one of these. Below are some sites I found during my travels around the internet, that digital product designers and fellow technophiles may find helpful or interesting.</p>
<h2 id="haikei-app">Haikei App</h2>

<p>While we are in the throws of updating the development stack for myClin I wanted to see what was passing for favicon standards these days. While one could get away with just the 16x16 pixel seen in the tab above. There are many other devices and screens to consider. Not to mention the rise in “dark mode” options in modern web applications.</p>
<p>If you are designing products for the web or really any application, you should give this one a read.</p>
<h2 id="omatsuri">Omatsuri</h2>

<p>This is a convenient set of open source tools for modern web developers. The concepts are fairly simple but real time savers when you are working on your projects. I find the JSON data generator particularly useful when making prototypes.</p>

<p>Accessibility had finally become an important consideration when developing software no matter what platform is being used. This article on uxmovement.com reveals some important guidelines when creating accessible form fields that are optimized for legibility.</p>

<p><a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/">https://watchy.sqfmi.com/</a></p>
<p>Finally, a smart watch concept I can get excited about. Watchy is an e-paper display, hackable smart watch built on Raspberry Pi Pico tech, this is a technophiles dream watch. I ordered one immediately although do not anticipate its arrival until early summer. Still, for $60, it seemed to be worth it.</p>

						<h1><a href="https://main.d3p1wyqeqwb6fs.amplifyapp.com/post/product-viability/">Want to know if your idea is viable?</a></h1>
						<span>Aug 13, 2020 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>Testing the viability of a product or service can be tricky. However, in my experience, I have found that if you explore the answers, provided by two fundamental questions, you can get to a final proof of viability. As well as gain a great foundation for the success of your business, its marketing goals and its customer support.</p>
<p><strong>Question 01: What problem does your product or service solve?</strong></p>
<p>The best products and services in history are supremely successful because they proverbially, scratch a certain itch, felt by enough people, to make a viable market. At times this market is well established, other times it is brand new. Either way, asking yourself if your product or service makes the problem easier to deal with or disappear completely, is a fundamental step.</p>
<p>As you begin to try and answer this question, inevitably, others will arise from it—Have others tried to solve this problem? If they have, what mistakes have they made? Is there enough need for the problem to be solved? I could go on and on.</p>
<p>What you are gaining from the answer to all of these questions is actionable data. This is essential to good decision making as well as good design. With this information you can better adjust the solution to better define and focus your idea and simplify the solution to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Question 02: Who does your product or service solve the problem for?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the itch you need to scratch must be felt by enough people to make a viable market. This viable market is relative, not only to the amount of people that need their problem solved but also who those people are who need it solved. Creating a medical related device has a smaller market base than a software solutions provider, but both could equally be multi-million dollar businesses.</p>
<p>When answering this you should not just stop and finding out why these people want or need this problem solved. You should be getting as detailed as you possibly can about who they are and what they want in a solution. I have found the “personas and scenarios” method to be incredibly helpful when exploring the wants and needs of a perceived market segment. This is done by identifying the different personas who would want or need the solution—Are they mostly men, women or gender neutral? What is their age range? What is their occupation? How do they spend their day? Again, I could go on.</p>
<p>Once you have established these personas, you should be able to develop various scenarios where each persona would benefit from the solution you are providing. This exercise provides helpful data in establishing which scenarios are the most common and stand to benefit the most. Again you now have the ability to make a more informed decision about how and where to focus the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the quest to find the viability of a product or service you would do well to explore the questions above. Data provided by your answers to these and subsequent questions they spawn, cannot only help you decide whether the product or service is viable, but also give you the foundation needed to build your product or service. This information is useful when applied to many facets of your business from marketing and sales strategy to financial planning and business operations.</p>
<p>With the answers to the questions above you will have a more stable foundation on which to build your business idea. Don’t limit your chances for success by not investing the time to fully explore all the paths they lead you down.</p>
