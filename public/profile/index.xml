      <description>Hello, my name is Johnny! First, thank you for visiting my site. No matter what brought you here, I appreciate your time and interest in who I am and what I do.&#xA;I am a digital product designer and front-end developer operating out of Philadelphia. My professional career began during the mid-90s after attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia where I studied industrial and product design. Quickly, my skills as a “computer nerd” coupled with my design abilities began revealing a path leading to a career in software and digital product development.</description>
