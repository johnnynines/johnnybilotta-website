# Hello, my name is Johnny!

First, thank you for visiting my site. No matter what brought you here, I appreciate your time and interest in who I am and what I do.

I am a digital product designer and front-end developer operating out of Philadelphia. My professional career began during the mid-90s. I started out as a graphic designer, in advertising, after attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia where I studied industrial and product design. Quickly, my skills as a “computer nerd” coupled with my design abilities began revealing a path leading to a career in software and digital product development.

Today I stand with the experience of a twenty-five year career in digital design behind me. I have worked on projects ranging from product development for Nike, to product development for Capital One. During the last fifteen years I have held leadership roles not only professionally, but within the technology community in and around Philadelphia. Currently, I hold the position as VP of Product Design for myClin. A software product that provides oversight of the assets and essential interactions between all entities conducting a clinical trial sponsored by major pharmaceutical companies.

My work and my personal life are very much interconnected through my love of technology. While I am not a full fledged software developer, I am able to code HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Bash. I am also proficient in all the major operating systems as well as the abilities to administer \*NIX, Windows and Apple systems, networks and other technology infrastructures.

When not pursuing new avenues of my career I spend my time learning ethical hacking, systems administration and network infrastructure. Sprinkle in some Destiny, Forza and various other games on my PC for fun. I also passionately follow motorsports, the Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Union and Tottenham Hotspur.

Currently I reside in Philadelphia, PA with my wife Abby, our two cats Dorian and Phe, and our dog Drax.
