Technology and design are constantly evolving, and I evolve with them. From pioneering virtual conference environments in the early 2000s to integrating AI capabilities into modern applications, I've consistently embraced emerging technologies to enhance the user experience.

Today, I'm exploring how AI and machine learning can augment the design and development process, enabling faster iteration while maintaining quality. I believe these tools don't replace human creativity and judgment â€“ they amplify our capabilities and allow us to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.
