# Project coding standards

## General Instructions
- Add a comment to the start of all Copilot generated code that reads "Generated by assistant"

## Naming Conventions
- Use dash-case for partials, template and markdown files
- Use camelCase for variables, functions and methods
- Prefix all posts with current date using the YYMMDD format

## Hugo Guidelines
- All partials should be placed in the /themes/strange-signal/partials directory
- All shortcodes should be placed in the /themes/strange-signal/shortcodes directory
- Use TOML and JSON for data and configurations instead of using YAML
