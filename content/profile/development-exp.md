## Technical Depth Enhancing Design Thinking

Unlike many design leaders, I don't just sketch ideas and hand them off. I contribute significant front-end code, establish technical architecture, and build functional prototypes. My programming journey spans multiple decades and languages â€“ from BASIC in the 1980s to modern JavaScript frameworks today.

This technical depth enables me to make more informed design decisions, anticipate implementation challenges, and communicate effectively with engineering teams. When I design a component, I understand how it will be built, what constraints might arise, and how to optimize for performance and scalability.
