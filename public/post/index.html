						<h1><a href="https://johnnybilotta.com/post/hugo-project-update/">Hugo Project Retrospective</a></h1>
						<span>Nov 10, 2021 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>At the beginning of the summer I began a project that I believed would take me about a month to complete. Now, at the beginning of November, I am finally shipping version one of this project. Join me for a retrospective look at making my personal site a Hugo generated static site.</p>
<h2 id="what-have-i-learned">What Have I Learned</h2>
<p>First, Hugo’s ease of use is a bit deceiving. On the surface it seems to make short work of putting a static website together. You add content in the form of markdown files, and provide templates written in HTML, along with some Go Lang functions and methods peppered in there to provide the “automation” of static site generation.</p>
<p>This is really powerful, but I found myself lost at first. I had diligently gone through documentation and was convinced I “got it”. However, when I finally started coding my own theme, things got a bit difficult. I found that I could not get the templates I was developing to do what I wanted them to do. Content was not being rendered the way I expected and frustration began to set it a bit.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the documentation that I thought I understood was reading like a foreign language. I needed better examples. I then went to find some premade themes on Hugo’s website. Their theme gallery provided quite a bit for me to choose. I found a few that looked good to learn from and I could reverse engineer, just to get the gist of how Hugo builds static content. This was incredibly helpful and where I should have started instead of jumping right into coding my own from scratch using only the documentation to guide me.</p>
<p>I also was very grateful to find there is a large community of Hugo developers that provide help to those who need it through the Hugo <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/">forums</a>. As a supplement to the forums I found only a couple of developers blogging about Hugo. One of the most helpful sites I found was <a href="https://www.regisphilibert.com/">Regis Philibert</a> His posts helped me make sense of the content organization and hierarchy. I am still not clear on how a few things operate but can say that I feel pretty comfortable at this point after reading the articles on his blog.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-pain-points">Biggest Pain Points</h2>
<p>While converting the site from Hugo to Wordpress there were several stumbling blocks I had to overcome that took some trial and error to get through. This is largely due to support for Hugo being isolated to the forums or a handful blogs that are writing about their experience with Hugo.</p>
<h3 id="comprehension-of-documentation">Comprehension of documentation</h3>
<p>The Hugo documentation is incredibly informative and helpful. Throughout the construction of this site, I had it readily available for reference in a browser tab. However, it helps if you are a bit more familiar with how everything fits together. There is really no ecosystem examples or step-by-step instruction. If you are not so versed in front-end technologies you may have an even bigger learning curve.</p>
<p>As mentioned above this shortcoming was overcome by viewing the code of some of the premade themes. Coupled with browsing and searching subject matter in the forums one is able to find a good primer for using the documentation to its full potential.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-leafs-and-bundles">Understanding Leafs and Bundles</h3>
<p>One of the most important things to understand in Hugo is how content is managed. This means understanding page “leafs” and “bundles” which can be a bit confusing until you get some real world examples going. Thankfully I found this wonderful article by <a href="https://twitter.com/kaushalmodi/">@kaushalmodi</a> about halfway through my third frustrating day messing about with it all.</p>
<p>If you can get a good grasp of page bundles then you can master a lot of the power Hugo has to offer.</p>
<h3 id="deployment--publishing">Deployment / Publishing</h3>
<p>If you are building a blog or a site that needs several content updates per week or even month, deploying those changes can be a bit cumbersome for newcomers. There are several avenues one could take depending on their web environment. Netlify, is incredibly popular with the community but you can publish your site to any service you choose.  and getting things up and running with the static site on an S3 buck</p>
<p>Personally, I use AWS for my projects so I stuck with it when I went to deploy. It took me a bit of time to get it all worked out as there is really little in terms of documentation for this on Hugo’s website. <a href="https://nickolaskraus.org/articles/hosting-a-static-website-with-hugo-and-aws/">This article</a> by Nickolas Kraus gave me a ton of help and furthered my understanding. While that piece got me out of the deployment weeds I think I may to a different setup using AWS Amplify. I am currently exploring that avenue.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I love Hugo and what it has to offer as a static site generator. If you have the desire to move off of a CMS like Wordpress or Drupal, it provides a lot of what you need without all the backend hassle. Now, if you are new to web development in general, it is not going to be easy to pick up. However, I do believe if your desire is to build business, marketing, and blog type websites, learning how to use a static site generator like Hugo is a good idea.</p>

						<h1><a href="https://johnnybilotta.com/post/hugo-project/">June Project: Create A Static Site Using Hugo</a></h1>
						<span>Jun 10, 2021 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>I have been thinking about moving away from Wordpress and convert this site to static HTML generated by some kind of framework. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is the security leaks that come with using Wordpress. Going static will also mean virtually no updates needed to the server, no database updates or the need for any specialty plugins. So this month I have given myself the challenge of migrating this site away from Wordpress, and learning Hugo to generate a static HTML version of my blog. Before I get into this I want to just point out, this is not a tutorial or walkthrough. More of an opinion from a designer/front-end dev.</p>
<h2 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo?</h2>
<p>Not long ago, while exploring <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a friend’s company website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I asked him what they used to manage their content. I noticed they had blog posts, and I know that this person would never allow their company website to be written in PHP. This prompted me to ask him about it, at which point he gives me the skinny tour of their setup, including the infrastructure, and introduced me to Hugo. After doing a little more digging about how Hugo works and how to get a static site to look the way I wished, I was convinced it was the right direction.</p>
<p>This project not only allows me to learn a new way to produce rich content websites, it also gives me the opportunity to audit and consolidate a lot of dirty code that I have amassed over the years on my site. I also get the chance to develop a new development jig for coding front-end sites. Lots of upside.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-know-hugo">Getting To Know Hugo</h2>
<p>Hugo is written in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, however you do not need to be fluent or even know Go to benefit from its features. However you will need a good grasp on interfacing using the command line, as well as understand fundamental web programming concepts in order to really expand on what comes out of the box.</p>
<p>Despite Hugo having a sizable community of theme creators and a bunch of pre-made themes, I am going to roll my own so I can have more control of the foundation. Hugo uses <code>.html</code> files for the guts of the setup. They can be used to template whole pages or as partials which can be utilized as components. Hugo projects are configured using <code>.toml</code> files but you can easily use <code>.json</code>in its place. I am sticking with <code>.json</code> for this current project because I am most familiar with its syntax. However I can see the simplicity of <code>.toml</code> and may dive into that later.</p>
<p>As for content, like blogs, Hugo uses markdown files that you publish to your server via the command line. They live on your local machine or you can alias the source files to have them live wherever you please. This replaces the need for a database maintain, along with all the taxonomies and such. When you are done updating your content, Hugo packages up the changes and publishes them to your web server.</p>
<h2 id="how-its-going-so-far">How Its Going So Far</h2>
<p>Up to this point, I have read about 60% of Hugo&rsquo;s documentation and installed it on my Mac and PC using Homebrew and Chocolatey respectively. The set up of a new local site is really easy, as is setting up the foundation needed to use a custom theme. Hugo basically comes with nothing unless you get a theme installed. I mean, there are directories and placeholders files that get created when you run the command, <code>&quot;hugo new site nameofyoursite&quot;</code> but when you run the server you get a blank screen with no console output. You essentially have to build your site framework from the ground up. Which is just fine with me to be honest. This is what I wanted—something light and simple that would allow me to dictate the build process and manage my content.</p>
<p>While Hugo has modules that it uses to automate tasks such as converting SASS into CSS, or consolidating javascript; I have elected to write my own automation using Gulp until I have a better understanding of the Hugo modules that are available for use.</p>
<p>I have a working template that I pieced together using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have also setup the basic Gulp tasks, added Bootstrap and Font Awesome. Next up is to build out some more theme pages (About, 404, etc.) then get a server environment setup to host the site on AWS within the next week. At that point I hope to share my progress via a follow up post.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn how to use Hugo I suggest you go to their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and get familiar with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Follow the quick start guide and you will be on your way. If you have experience setting up back-end systems for your website you should be able to grasp what is happening. Just experiment as I am doing and you will undoubtedly learn from the experience.</p>

						<h1><a href="https://johnnybilotta.com/post/destiny-wallpaper/">Wallpaper Wednesday: Destiny 2</a></h1>
						<span>Apr 18, 2021 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>Wallpaper Wednesday is a practice I have not done for many years. In the early days of Indy Hall I would put out a digital wallpaper each week. This helped me stay fresh with design and the suite of tools I use on a regular basis. It also gave me the freedom to explore concepts I normally would not be able to while completing client work. I am humbly attempting to revive this practice with this initial release of the new Wallpaper Wednesday.</p>
<p>This week’s inspiration: Destiny 2 character, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Warmind</p>
<p>I have been using my down time to grind out some missions in Destiny 2 to prepare for the new expansion dropping in November.</p>
<p>A huge part of these missions is running around the system doing tasks for the Warmind AI named, Rasputin. In the game, the Warmind is a sentient, artificial intelligence built by humanity to protect us and the solar system from interstellar threats. While the concept is literally out of this world (the Warmind resides on Mars.) The game designers added some interesting designs to the terminals scattered all over the system, in so much that they used ASCII inspired designs. This, in turn, inspired me to create some digital wallpapers for mobile and desktop, featuring some of the symbols that represent the Warmind and various subroutines.</p>
<p>If you do not play Destiny this will all sound like a bunch of hooey. However the designs of these wallpapers are for all to enjoy. Even more so for those who play Destiny.</p>

						<h1><a href="https://johnnybilotta.com/post/product-viability/">Want to know if your idea is viable?</a></h1>
						<span>Aug 13, 2020 by Johnny Bilotta</span>
					</div>

					<p>Testing the viability of a product or service can be tricky. However, in my experience, I have found that if you explore the answers, provided by two fundamental questions, you can get to a final proof of viability. As well as gain a great foundation for the success of your business, its marketing goals and its customer support.</p>
<p><strong>Question 01: What problem does your product or service solve?</strong></p>
<p>The best products and services in history are supremely successful because they proverbially, scratch a certain itch, felt by enough people, to make a viable market. At times this market is well established, other times it is brand new. Either way, asking yourself if your product or service makes the problem easier to deal with or disappear completely, is a fundamental step.</p>
<p>As you begin to try and answer this question, inevitably, others will arise from it—Have others tried to solve this problem? If they have, what mistakes have they made? Is there enough need for the problem to be solved? I could go on and on.</p>
<p>What you are gaining from the answer to all of these questions is actionable data. This is essential to good decision making as well as good design. With this information you can better adjust the solution to better define and focus your idea and simplify the solution to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Question 02: Who does your product or service solve the problem for?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the itch you need to scratch must be felt by enough people to make a viable market. This viable market is relative, not only to the amount of people that need their problem solved but also who those people are who need it solved. Creating a medical related device has a smaller market base than a software solutions provider, but both could equally be multi-million dollar businesses.</p>
<p>When answering this you should not just stop and finding out why these people want or need this problem solved. You should be getting as detailed as you possibly can about who they are and what they want in a solution. I have found the “personas and scenarios” method to be incredibly helpful when exploring the wants and needs of a perceived market segment. This is done by identifying the different personas who would want or need the solution—Are they mostly men, women or gender neutral? What is their age range? What is their occupation? How do they spend their day? Again, I could go on.</p>
<p>Once you have established these personas, you should be able to develop various scenarios where each persona would benefit from the solution you are providing. This exercise provides helpful data in establishing which scenarios are the most common and stand to benefit the most. Again you now have the ability to make a more informed decision about how and where to focus the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the quest to find the viability of a product or service you would do well to explore the questions above. Data provided by your answers to these and subsequent questions they spawn, cannot only help you decide whether the product or service is viable, but also give you the foundation needed to build your product or service. This information is useful when applied to many facets of your business from marketing and sales strategy to financial planning and business operations.</p>
<p>With the answers to the questions above you will have a more stable foundation on which to build your business idea. Don’t limit your chances for success by not investing the time to fully explore all the paths they lead you down.</p>
