# Bridging Design Vision and Technical Mastery

## The Fusion of Design & Development

I'm a strategic design leader and product innovator with over 25 years of experience crafting exceptional digital experiences across FinTech, Healthcare, and Logistics sectors. What sets me apart is my rare combination of design leadership and technical fluency – I don't just envision great products, I understand how to build them.

My journey began in 1983 at age 7, when I wrote my first BASIC program on an Apple IIe. By my teens, I was mastering AutoCAD and providing electronic drafting services to engineering firms. This foundation of technical understanding has informed my approach to design throughout my career, enabling me to create solutions that are both visually compelling and technically feasible.

Throughout my career as a digital designer, I've leveraged my dual expertise to drive transformation for organizations ranging from startups to enterprise clients like Nike, Kimberly-Clark, CapitalOne, BlackRock and Fidelity. In my most recent positions, I have revitalized a stagnant product by implementing structured release cycles that delivered 350+ improvements annually. And prior to that, I orchestrated a strategic partnership with American Express, introducing charitable contribution solutions that expanded from 25,000 to 200,000 users within months of launch.

## Technical Depth Enhancing Design Thinking

Unlike many design leaders, I don't just sketch ideas and hand them off. I contribute significant front-end code, establish technical architecture, and build functional prototypes. My programming journey spans multiple decades and languages – from BASIC in the 1980s to modern JavaScript frameworks today.

This technical depth enables me to make more informed design decisions, anticipate implementation challenges, and communicate effectively with engineering teams. When I design a component, I understand how it will be built, what constraints might arise, and how to optimize for performance and scalability.

## Creating Impact Through User-Centered Solutions

For me, success isn't measured by aesthetic appeal alone – it's about solving real problems for users and delivering measurable business impact. While I was the VP of Product Design at myClin, I conducted user research and pattern analysis to optimize clinical trial workflow experiences. At Traffic Safety Store, my redesign increased conversion rates from 40% to 92% within six months of launch.

I believe great products emerge at the intersection of user needs, business objectives, and technical feasibility. By understanding all three dimensions, I create solutions that not only delight users but also drive meaningful results.

## Continuous Learning and Innovation

Technology and design are constantly evolving, and I evolve with them. From pioneering virtual conference environments in the early 2000s to integrating AI capabilities into modern applications, I've consistently embraced emerging technologies to enhance the user experience.

Today, I'm exploring how AI and machine learning can augment the design and development process, enabling faster iteration while maintaining quality. I believe these tools don't replace human creativity and judgment – they amplify our capabilities and allow us to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.

## Let's Create Something Remarkable

Whether you're looking to transform an existing product, launch something new, or build a high-performing design team, I bring a unique combination of strategic vision, design expertise, and technical knowledge to the table. I'm passionate about creating digital experiences that make a difference – and I'd love to discuss how we might collaborate.
